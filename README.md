# MY-WEBSITE

I developed a simple, responsive website consisting of three pages: Home, About, and Contact. Each page uses Bootstrap 5 for styling and layout, ensuring the site is mobile-friendly and visually appealing.

How I Did It:

I utilized ChatGPT to assist me throughout the development process. ChatGPT helped me by generating the initial HTML structure, suggesting Bootstrap components, and guiding me on best practices for layout composition and design. Using this support, I was able to quickly build a clean and functional website with cohesive navigation and consistent styling.

Key Learnings:

Practical use of Bootstrap components for responsive design.

Structuring multi-page websites with consistent navigation.

Leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT to accelerate coding and problem-solving.
